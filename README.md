# plumbing_disaster
Very simplistic randomly-generated pipe fixing game I made a while ago with SDL 2.

# Pre-requisites
All these components are listed on the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* SDL 2.0.8 (or greater)
* SDL_Image
* SDL_Mixer
* SDL_TTF

# Additional notes
Expect some minor bugs; I made this while I was learning SDL 2 and hadn't a clue about Pragmatic programming. Oh, and by the way - the generation is completely random. That means there are some pipe configurations that might actually be impossible to solve. You've been warned!
